Pricing is so much integral to the success of any organization. As a matter of fact, getting 2% increase in the pricing is equivalent to 4% increase in the revenue in terms of net dollar generated for the company (for a company with 50% gross margin). 

Pricing is very sensitive topic. For this reason, you will not find big industrial companies publish their list prices on the public platform. List prices are considered confidential documents meant exclusively for dealers and distributors. Companies do not want easy access of the list price because this will allow competition to compare their prices and adjust them to compete effectively in the market. 

In this article, we will discuss the price discovery model. This is very useful for new product managers, innovators, Marketing team and pricing analyst. The model will be explained with the help of an example – Pricing of a fan

Typically, there are four steps for the price discovery model 

    1. Identify the benefits (value proposition vs existing competition)
    2. Quantity the benefits
    3. Visual representation of quantified value
    4. 20% - 50% price premium to the added to the standard competition price
    
Let us take an example of a company in Mumbai launching a fan in the market. They want to use the price discovery model to determine the pricing – 

**Step 1 - Identify the benefits**

After discussing with initial user group, engineering team and reports from internal testing, following benefits are identified -
 
- Provide premium performance at par with the fan available in the market
- Very less sound (Around 20DB, 40DB is generally available in the market)
-  App based control - Regulator, on and off, current status, power consumption details 
    
**Step 2 - Quantity the benefits**

They have conducted the exploratory focus group discussion to understand how much people are willing to pay for silent fan and app based control. Based on the inputs received they are quantifying the benefits.

**Step 3. Visual representation of the quantified benefits**

Total value generated because of two additional features is close to 20 thousand rupees. To quantity the benefits, marketing team needs to discuss with the product users and get into details of the benefits. Your users will let you lot about the benefits sometime those use cases are not even considered by the product team. More the number of discussion, the more would be the accuracy of the quantified benefit.

**Step 4 – Decide on the pricing**

You can add 20% - 50% of the premium generated to the pricing depending on the maturity of the product category and how users perceive the category. In case of the fan, we would like to take 25% to be the price. 

Market price of competition with standard features – 4000

Total Premium generated for additional features - 20160

Price of this newly launched fan = 4000 + 20160*.25 = 9000 INR approximately
